Project: SQL Data Analysis on Netflix Titles

In this project, I connected Python with SQL in a Jupyter Notebook environment to perform in-depth data analysis on a Netflix dataset. I imported the dataset into an SQLite database and executed a series of SQL queries to extract valuable insights. The project involved a variety of SQL operations, including SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, UNION, CASE, and others, all integrated seamlessly with Python using Pandas and SQLite. This approach enabled efficient data querying, manipulation, and analysis within a Python environment.
